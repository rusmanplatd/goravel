```

## Encryption Flow

### Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)
1. User generates identity key pair
2. User generates signed prekey and one-time prekeys
3. Prekey bundle shared with other users
4. Messages use ephemeral keys for each session
5. Keys are rotated regularly for security

### Direct Messages
1. Sender generates random AES key
2. Message encrypted with AES-256-GCM
3. AES key encrypted with recipient's public RSA key
4. Encrypted message + encrypted key sent to server
5. Recipient decrypts AES key with private RSA key
6. Recipient decrypts message with AES key

### Group Messages
1. Room has shared ChaCha20-Poly1305 key
2. Key encrypted for each member with their public RSA key
3. Messages encrypted with room key
4. Members decrypt room key with private RSA key
5. Members decrypt messages with room key

### File Sharing
1. File encrypted with AES-256-GCM
2. File key encrypted for each recipient
3. Encrypted file stored on server
4. Recipients decrypt file key and file content

### Key Rotation
1. Admin triggers key rotation
2. New room key generated
3. Old key deactivated
4. New key encrypted for all members
5. Future messages use new key

## Real-time Events

### Event Types
- `message_sent`: New message sent
- `message_received`: Message received
- `message_read`: Message marked as read
- `member_joined`: New member joined room
- `member_left`: Member left room
- `reaction_added`: Reaction added to message
- `reaction_removed`: Reaction removed from message
- `room_updated`: Room information updated
- `key_rotated`: Room key rotated

### WebSocket Events
```json
{
  "type": "message_sent",
  "room_id": "room_123",
  "user_id": "user_456",
  "data": {
    "message_id": "msg_789",

chatRoom, err := chatService.CreateChatRoom(
    "Team Discussion",
    "Main team channel",
    "group",
    tenantID,
    userID,
    []string{"user1", "user2", "user3"},
)
```

### Sending a Message

```go
message, err := chatService.SendMessageWithNotification(
    roomID,
    senderID,
    "text",
    "Hello, team!",
    nil,
    nil,
)
```

### Adding a Reaction

```go
reaction, err := chatService.AddMessageReactionWithNotification(
    messageID,
    userID,
    "üëç",
)
```

### Sharing an Encrypted File

```go
e2eeService := services.NewE2EEService()

fileData := []byte("sensitive file content")
encryptedFile, err := e2eeService.EncryptFile(
    fileData,
    "document.pdf",
    "application/pdf",
    []string{recipientPublicKey},
)
```

### Generating PFS Keys

```go
e2eeService := services.NewE2EEService()

prekeyBundle, err := e2eeService.GeneratePrekeyBundle(userID, deviceID)
if err != nil {
    // Handle error
}

// Save keys to database
for _, prekey := range prekeyBundle.OneTimePrekeys {
    userKey := &models.UserKey{
        UserID:             userID,
        KeyType:            "one_time_prekey",
        PublicKey:          prekey.PublicKey,
        EncryptedPrivateKey: prekey.PrivateKey,
        Version:            1,
        IsActive:           true,
    }
    e2eeService.SaveUserKey(userKey)
